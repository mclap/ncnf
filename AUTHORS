Originally, this library is a truly collective effort by the members of
the Netli Inc. team, including, but not limited to (in order of participation):

Lev Walkin		vlm@		(original concept and implementation)
Sasha Kupriyanov	askuper@	(original concept and integration)
Suresh Yanamadala	surra@		(extensions)
Adam Grove		grove@		(created order from chaos)
Dmitry Tweritin		snaky@		(domain handling)
Joe Rouvier		joe@		(extensions)
Igor Sviridov		sia@		(validator, extensions)
Martin (KaFai) Lau	kafai@		(extensions)
Dmitry Kohmanyuk	dk@		(NCQL, extensions)

All the deficiencies, including code bloat, are all mine -- vlm.
